                            <p>A freelancer is a self-employed person who offers services, often working on several jobs for multiple clients at one time.</p>

                            <p>Freelancers usually earn money on a per-job basis, charging hourly or daily rates for their work. </p>
                            <p>While a freelancer is not permanent employee of any company, they can be subcontracted by other businesses. It’s common for freelancers to work on several different jobs or projects at once</p>
                            <p>Freelancers have a variety of reasons for freelancing, the perceived benefits differ by gender,
                             industry, and lifestyle. For instance, the 2012 Freelance Industry Report reported that men and women freelance for different reasons. Female survey respondents indicated that they prefer the scheduling freedom and flexibility that freelancing offers, while male survey respondents indicated they freelance to follow or pursue personal passions. Freelancing also enables people to obtain higher levels of employment in isolated communities. The ability to pick and choose who the freelancer works with is another benefit. The freelancer interviews a potential client and they get to pick whether or not to work with that individual or company for make it easy Infops works as a bridge between client and freelancer.</p>
